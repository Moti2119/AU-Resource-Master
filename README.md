# AU-Resource-Master
ResourceMaster is a University Resource Planning platform that gives administrators complete visibility and control over all campus resources. The system tracks inventory across all locations (libraries, print houses, cafeterias, classrooms, labs), predicts when resources will run out, and automates purchase requisitions.
